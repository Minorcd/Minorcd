Hey There!

My name is Caeleb.
I usually go by either my username, my gamertag (GodofLegends or just Legend), or just by my regular name.

My Interests
  - Coding (Languages: C/C++, C#, Java, Python, and HTML/CSS)
  - Anime/Manga (Favorite Anime: Fairy Tail/ Favorite Manga: Tokyo Ghoul)
  - Comic Books (DC/Marvel/Image)
  - Video Games (Fighting Games, Single-Player Story, or Online Multiplayer) (Currently Playing: Elden Ring SOTE)
  - Graphic Design (Making iPhone wallpapers and etc)
  - Creative Writing (Not but experience but I wanna get into the habit of writing stories)
  - Blacksmithing (No experience yet but I wanna try it)

As of writing this (07/08/2024) I am currently a junior @ Old Dominion University and I am majoring in Computer Science and will be graduating May of 2026

My goal with this page is to network. Potentially meeting friends, project  partners, and employers. 
I also want to improve my coding ability as far as improving syntax, ease of readability, and making my lines of code more efficient.

(I sometimes slack off on practicing during the break periods in between school ðŸ˜…)

I also want to start either working towards gaining an internship doing software development or earning certification to help build my resume.
With how competitive the field is becoming I will take all the advice I can get so feel free to message me.

Hope that helps you learn a bit about me. Hope we work on something together soon.
